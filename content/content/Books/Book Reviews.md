draft: "True"

I decided to write a bit about books that I read. I think that it would help to form a more coherent opinion about them, grafted from the multitude of random thoughts that plague my mind as I read them.
In my opinion, writing fiction can traditionally be divided into two arts (Which can recursively be broken into many more, but I will focus on these two):
1. Given the full **dry** details of a scene/situation (i.e. setting, actors, dialogue ideas, etc), describe it aesthetically, accurately and consistently.
2. Arrange groups of dry details on a timeline. Iteratively optimize - change, merge and break apart these groups. In each step, take into account the entirety of the work until this point (where the base case is the original concept).

For now, I'm ignoring the critical detail of the exact goals of the optimization (the loss function, in mathematical terms) in both of the arts.  
I think that as good fiction authors write, they encompass the full story in their minds. This doesn't mean that they miraculously know story, and simply have to let it out. In fact, it's tightly woven with the second art, where the input of each iteration is the "story up until this point". A good author would do well to remember the formative moment in chapter 5, and in the next iteration allude to it on chapter 3 and apply it's results on chapter 7. Sorting the wheat from the chaff in the existing known story for such examples is also an art in and of itself.

After some reflection, I feel that I wrote a lot of bullshit. An argument that I can't easily formulate - I have pinpointed to the phrase "local minima". well no you can still backtrack. yeahhh im good
