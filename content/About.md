#### > who am I?
My name is Roi Eliasian. 
I am interested in Computer Science, Mathematics, Coding, Biology, and Data Science. 
I am also a student, video game developer, Hebrew poet, nerd, gamer, and a reader. My favourite book is probably [The Brothers Karamazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov). 

Currently I am studying towards a BSc in computer science and computational biology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI). Additionally, I perform research in [Dr. Barak Raveh's lab](https://www.ravehlab.org/), where I helped develop a computational High-Speed [Atomic Force Microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy) Simulation, specializing in imaging of the [Nuclear Pore Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pore).
