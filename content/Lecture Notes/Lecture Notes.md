I supply here some of my lecture notes I took during my university studies. Most of the notes are written in Hebrew. and some are in handwriting while others are typed out. All credit goes to the Hebrew university and the respective course staff.
 
For other HUJI notes I highly recommend taking a look at [Barzilay's](https://github.com/NitzanBarzilay/Notes) and [Deychev's](https://deychev.com/) notes both of which tend to be better formatted than mine.
Also, you can take a look at this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IMuaVvdKgdZs59Ot8q0kU3f8movT0-6uFazlA-IbDuo/edit#heading=h.xlqfa8g3de05), for a comprehensive list of notes and other STEM course material in Israel.

Feel free to contact me for any inquiries.
